Welcome to the personal home page of **Sridhar Ratnakumar**, a passionate [Haskeller](https://www.haskell.org/) and an [actualist](https://www.actualists.org/). I work as a Haskell consultant ([see résumé]( https://srid.keybase.pub/resume.pdf)).

This entire site is modeled based on the [Zettelkasten](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125) note taking method, and implemented using [neuron](https://neuron.srid.ca).
