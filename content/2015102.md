title: How I use Emacs

[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is an extensible and customizable
text editor that is popular among certain programming language communities.
Emacs is also suited for taking notes (Ã  la. [orgmode](https://orgmode.org/);
though I favour [zettelkasten](https://neuron.srid.ca/)). There are various "configuration kits" for Emacs. I use [**doom-emacs**](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs). 

This article provides a brief overview of my workflow. However if you are new to Emacs, after installing these programs you should familiarize yourself with Vim keybindings (there are sevaral vim tutorials online for this) before proceeding.

## Preliminaries

The most important shortcut to know is [SPC :][kbd], which allows you to run any
[emacs command](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractiveFunction). If you want to find out which function a particular shortcut invokes, use [SPC h k][kbd] followed by that shortcut. For the obverse---to find out the shortcut (and documentaion) for a particular function---use [SPC h f][kbd].

## Files & Buffers

Open a file:

- [SPC f f][kbd] - Open a file
- [SPC f r][kbd] - Open a recently visited file

Manage buffers:

- [SPC b b][kbd] - Switch between open buffers
- [SPC b s][kbd] - Save the active buffer
- [SPC b k][kbd] - Kill (i.e., close) the active buffer
- [SPC b l][kbd] - Switch to the last buffer

## Search

- [SPC s p][kbd] - Search across all files in the project
- [SPC s s][kbd] - Search the active buffer

## Layout

### Window management

- [SPC w s][kbd] - Split window (horizontally)
- [SPC w v][kbd] - Split window vertically
- [SPC w d][kbd] - Delete the active window
- [SPC w w][kbd] / [SPC w W][kbd] - Move cursor to the next / previous window
- [CTRL+w m m][kbd] - Maximize / restore the current buffer

### Workspace management

Think of emacs workspaces as "virtual desktops".

- [SPC TAB TAB][kbd] - Display the workspace tabbar 
- [SPC TAB n][kbd] - Create a new workspace
- [SPC TAB 1][kbd] - Go to workspace #1
- [SPC TAB 2][kbd] - Go to workspace #2 (and etc...)
- [SPC TAB \`][kbd] - Switch to the last workspace

#### Project

- [SPC p f][kbd] or [SPC SPC][kbd] - Open a file in the project
- [SPC o P][kbd] - Open a file in the project, using the project sidebar
- [SPC o p][kbd] - Show / Hide the project sidebar

## Git

doom-emacs uses [magit](https://magit.vc/). [SPC g g][kbd] brings the magit-status buffer. The following shortcuts work on this buffer:

- [s][kbd] - Stage the selected file(s) or hunk
- [u][kbd] - Unstage the selected file(s) or hunk
- [TAB][kbd] - View/Hide the diff of a selected file
- [c c][kbd] - Commit the staged changes
- [p p][kbd] - Push commits to remote repository
- [d r][kbd] - Diff range (eg: to view changes in current branch)

## Code navigation

See also: [tools/lookup](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/tree/develop/modules/tools/lookup)

- [g;][kbd] - Go to last change
- [SPC s i][kbd] - Go to a symbol (eg: function) in current buffer
- [SPC c D][kbd] (or [gD][kbd]) - See a list of references for the symbol at point from throughout your project

## Editing

### Visual mode

After having selected some text:

- [S\*][kbd] - Surround selection with '`*`'

[kbd]: kbd:
