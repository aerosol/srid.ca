title: Being a carnivore in Quebec City
---

Many butcher shops and grocery stores in Quebec City tend to carry lean meat owing to current public demand---you can blame the dietary guidelines for that. Fattier cuts are harder to come by. However medium (*mi-maigre*, in French) ground beef is a reliable option.

## Costco

Costco sells AAA ribeye and striploin steaks that are far cheaper than elsewhere.

## Boucherie Eumatimi

**Chuck steak** (*palette de boeuf*, in French) at [Boucherie Eumatimi](https://goo.gl/maps/jj4iXi8im8n25Wxv6) is usually well-marbelled at Prime grade while being cheaper, and is delicious when cooked [sous-vide](/sous-vide.html) 24 hours. It needs spices, mainly pepper and garlic.

## Marché Label Terre

If beef is not your thing, then [Marché Label Terre](http://www.marchelabelterre.com/) sells **lamb belly** that is supremely fatty. If you ask, they will provide harder to come by organ meats, like spleen and brain.

## Fatworks

[Fatworks](https://fatworksfoods.com/) is a food company in the United States of America, so you will need to order online and pay customs fees. They sell **organic 100% grass-fed tallow** which I find to be a perfect fat to cook meat with (it imparts flavour when stir-frying ground beef).

## Phil smoked meat

For eating out, the only restaurant I can recommend is [Phil smoked meat](http://philsmokedmeat.com/). Delicious smoked meat, but be wary of what else they add to it. Last I checked, it was a variety of spices with small amounts of sugar. The waitresses are not always well informed, so ask the owner directly as to what else goes in the meat.
