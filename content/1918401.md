I eat exclusively meat.

## Why?

In early 2013 a reckless general medical practitioner prescribed me enough antibiotics to [mess up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysbiosis) my gut microbiome. This lead to what was then a mild folliculitis to become severe chronic folliculitis with chronic seborrhoeic dermatitis following suit.

I suffered with this condition for over 4 years, and saw plethora of dermatologists \(who knew naught but to prescribe ever more antibiotics\). Then, just within two weeks of going on the carnivore diet \(beef, salt and pepper\) my symptoms reduced to about 95%.

## Is it safe?

Contrary to popular belief, the carnivore diet provides all the necessary nutrients and is generally safe to do long-term. Meat is [nutritionally complete food](http://www.diagnosisdiet.com/food/meats/), and [some indigenous groups](https://justmeat.co/peoples/) have traditionally eaten an all-meat diet.

One ought to pay lip service to general medical wisdom and any dominant nutrition ideology as they are laced with an anti-meat bias \(see below\) using [problematic epidemiological studies](https://www.diagnosisdiet.com/epidemilogical-studies/) where, depending on the researcher's nutritional bias, one can establish [_any_ food item to be problematic](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/97/1/127/4576988). For a telling instance of how biased health organizations can be, refer to Dr. David M Klurfeld's [report](https://peakhuman.libsyn.com/dr-david-klurfeld-on-meat-not-causing-cancer-bogus-vegetarian-scientists-and-balanced-nutrition) of his experience with a WHO working group:

* \[Dr. David M Klurfeld\] was on the World Health Organization working group to decide if meat causes cancer in 2015 with a bunch of vegetarians and vegans and says it was the most frustrating professional experience of his life
* There were 22 scientists - half of which were epidemiologists
* They claimed they used 800 studies but they actually only used 18
* There was a group of people that were strongly against the vote
* He thinks a number of the people made up their minds before they even arrived

## Being a carnivore in Quebec City

Many butcher shops and grocery stores in Quebec City tend to carry lean meat owing to current public demand---you can blame the dietary guidelines for that. Fattier cuts are harder to come by. However medium (*mi-maigre*, in French) ground beef is a reliable option.

### Costco

Costco sells AAA ribeye and striploin steaks that are far cheaper than elsewhere.

### Boucherie Eumatimi

**Chuck steak** (*palette de boeuf*, in French) at [Boucherie Eumatimi](https://goo.gl/maps/jj4iXi8im8n25Wxv6) is usually well-marbelled at Prime grade while being cheaper, and is delicious when cooked [sous-vide](/sous-vide.html) 24 hours. It needs spices, mainly pepper and garlic.

### Marché Label Terre

If beef is not your thing, then [Marché Label Terre](http://www.marchelabelterre.com/) sells **lamb belly** that is supremely fatty. If you ask, they will provide harder to come by organ meats, like spleen and brain.

### Fatworks

[Fatworks](https://fatworksfoods.com/) is a food company in the United States of America, so you will need to order online and pay customs fees. They sell **organic 100% grass-fed tallow** which I find to be a perfect fat to cook meat with (it imparts flavour when stir-frying ground beef).

### Phil smoked meat

For eating out, the only restaurant I can recommend is [Phil smoked meat](http://philsmokedmeat.com/). Delicious smoked meat, but be wary of what else they add to it. Last I checked, it was a variety of spices with small amounts of sugar. The waitresses are not always well informed, so ask the owner directly as to what else goes in the meat.
