# Downgrade yourself on burnout

Burnout[^def] can happen on hobby projects too. When burnt out, don't *force* yourself to plod through the slough[^work]; instead, "downgrade" yourself to work on easier/ more trivial (in importance)/ smaller tasks[^eg]. Once momentum builds over, "upgrade" to the usual (challenging) tasks, but this time with a renewed sense of energy and enthusiasm that enables the state of flow. 

## Allow idleness

To "downgrade" oneself is just a specific form of the ultimate philosophical approach of being idle, which isn't the same as being inactive.

> Rousseau wrote in praise of **idleness**, but he clarified that the type of idleness he loved was “not that of a do-nothing who stays there with his arms crossed in total inactivity and thinks no more than he acts.” Instead, he spent time walking, reading, embarking on projects and quickly abandoning them, acting upon whims, “in sum, musing all day long without order and without sequence”—and that this was a fertile activity in itself. It led him to new projects and unforeseen breakthroughs. Should we all make time for undirected activity?

> There’s a story I refer to in my book that I like very much, quoted by Sextus Empiricus, the later Greek philosopher who formalised and systematised Skepticism. He has a story about the painter Apelles, who was desperately trying to paint the foam spilling from a horse’s mouth. Every attempt made him despair and scream with frustration, and so he ended up throwing his sponge at the canvas. And when the sponge fell on the canvas, exactly the right effect was created at the horse’s mouth.

[^def]: Burnout is defined as "*a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress. It occurs when you feel overwhelmed, emotionally drained, and unable to meet constant demands.*" --[helpguide.org](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/stress/burnout-prevention-and-recovery.htm#:~:text=Burnout%20is%20a%20state%20of,unable%20to%20meet%20constant%20demands.)

[^work]: Open question: what would be good approach in *work* projects (where there are often deadlines and clear responsibilities)?

[^eg]: As an example, switch from regular software projects to the backlog of system-admin'ish tasks one has been meaning to do (eg: try out that cool Vim extension now, or fix Linux hybrid graphics configuration on your laptop).
