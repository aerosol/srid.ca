# Downgrade yourself on burnout

Burnout[^def] can happen on hobby projects too. When burnt out, don't *force* yourself to plod through the slough[^work]; instead, "downgrade" yourself to work on easier/ more trivial (in importance)/ smaller tasks[^eg]. Once momentum builds over, "upgrade" to the usual (challenging) tasks, but this time with a renewed sense of energy and enthusiasm that enables the state of flow. 

[^def]: Burnout is defined as "*a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress. It occurs when you feel overwhelmed, emotionally drained, and unable to meet constant demands.*" --[helpguide.org](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/stress/burnout-prevention-and-recovery.htm#:~:text=Burnout%20is%20a%20state%20of,unable%20to%20meet%20constant%20demands.)

[^work]: Open question: what would be good approach in *work* projects (where there are often deadlines and clear responsibilities)?

[^eg]: As an example, switch from regular software projects to the backlog of system-admin'ish tasks one has been meaning to do (eg: try out that cool Vim extension now, or fix your laptop's hybrid graphics configuratoin on Linux).
