1. **Conditional happiness** (It is silly not to do things that give us satisfaction in life)
2. **Unconditional happiness** (It is silly to let things out of control make us feel bad)
3. **Naivete** (It is silly to be sophisticated, etc.)
4. **Pure Intent / PCE / AF** (It is silly to "*be*").

An adaptation of [Maslow's
hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs) to
actualism progress.
