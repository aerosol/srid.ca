# Using Twitter

{.ui .message}
This is a work-in-progress note, created on the day I decided to [re-join Twitter](https://twitter.com/sridca). Over the coming weeks, I'll see how this experiment goes and update this note accordingly.

I'm not a huge fan of Twitter for several reasons; however, there is one good reason to be on Twitter: **social engagement**.[^not-just-twitter]

[^not-just-twitter]: Of course that can be said for any platform where people participate and interact with one another: reddit, Zulip, Slack, Discord, etc.

## Twitter codes

- Restrict Twitter use (don't monitor all day)
- Stick to programming content 
  - Twitter is unsuited for <1f881332?cf>.
- Mute people who tweet with a negative vibe[^vibe].
  - This is especially the case with the "woke" crowd.

## Tools

- Remove distracting rubbish 
  - On desktop, use [Minimal Twitter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/minimal-twitter/pobhoodpcipjmedfenaigbeloiidbflp/related?hl=en)
  - On mobile, ... ?

[^vibe]: Appearing negative (eg: when criticizing something) is not the same thing as emanating a negative **vibe**. Cf. <2015101?cf>.
