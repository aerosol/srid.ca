# Using Twitter

{.ui .message}
This is a work-in-progress note

I'm not a huge fan of Twitter for several reasons; however, there is one good reason to be on Twitter: **social engagement**.[^not-just-twitter]

[^not-just-twitter]: Of course that can be said for any platform where people participate and interact with one another.

## Twitter codes

- Restrict Twitter use (don't monitor all day)
- Mute annoying people
- Don't follow people who tweet with a negative vibe[^vibe]
  - Often the case with the "woke" crowd.

[^vibe]: Appearing negative (eg: when criticizing something) is not the same thing as emanating a negative **vibe**. Cf. <2015101?cf>.
