The [official
docs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#installing-packages-from-external-sources)
explains how to install a package from a fork. My fork of flycheck-mmark patches
it to work with zettel-mode.

Add the following to `packages.el`:

```lisp
(package! flycheck-mmark
  :recipe
  (:host github
   :repo "srid/flycheck-mmark"
   :branch "patch-1"))
```

Configure it in `config.el`:

```lisp
(after! flycheck
  '(add-hook 'flycheck-mode-hook #'flycheck-mmark-setup))

(add-hook! 'markdown-mode-hook #'flycheck-mode)
(add-hook! 'zettel-mode-hook #'flycheck-mode)
```

Note that you still have to manually select the checker whenever opening a
zettel, using `M-x flycheck-select-checker`.
