> yes feel as good as you can whenever you can, but always FEEL. It is only by
  being very aware of feelings - good and bad, that you can progressively feel
  better. As a feeling being my motto was ‘always be feeling’

John C.M. to S:

> It's funny that I've spent years not heeding to this advice. It was just
  recently, through a mere coincidence, that I started to monitor my feelings
  24/7 again; like I used to do years ago! By doing it correctly I managed to
  drop a huge chunck of anxiety & sorrow in one 6 hour sitting, then really
  digging into each experienced feeling aknowleding 'em all as 'me'. I have
  therefore nailed the part about "attentiveness" and your little message here,
  onto my desktop so that I'll never forget about being a "feeling being" ever
  again.
