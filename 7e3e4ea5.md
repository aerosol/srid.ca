## The birth of daily notes

* In neuron, I have been designing a new interface for displaying zettel connections. [#195](https://github.com/srid/neuron/pull/195). 
  * During [a discussion](https://funprog.srid.ca/neuron/connections-panel-as-graph.html) about this design, Nadrieril referred to [Andy's notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6f6xgGG4NKjkA5NA1kDd46whJh2Gt5rAmfX?stackedNotes=z28QkpK3vRKQTacjFDfGYBhCXHqHuVWJzny9), which in turn inspired me to start writing daily notes in my Zettelkasten.
  * Later it occured to me ... why not publish (a cleaned up version of) these notes on the web as well? I thought that it would make for an interesting alternative to Twitter. It should not take any more 5 minutes to publish these. 

## Reflex discussion

Witnessed some interesting discussion about prerendering dynamic content (eg: those fetched from database) in the `#reflex-frp` IRC channel. You can view the [logs here](https://freenode.logbot.info/reflex-frp/20200518).

## Markdown editor that does not suck

Many rich text editors seem to convert back and forth with HTML. This is lossy. For example, many of them would eat up the [attributes](https://github.com/jgm/commonmark-hs/tree/master/commonmark-extensions) extended syntax in commonmark.

Somehow I stumbled upon [HyperMD](http://laobubu.net/HyperMD/) which strikes the right balance between the two. Turns out, it is built on top of [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) which itself has a decent [markdown mode](https://codemirror.net/mode/markdown/) that one can customize using CSS. Incidentally, CodeMirror also supports [VIM keybindings](https://codemirror.net/demo/vim.html). How cool is that?
