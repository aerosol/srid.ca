Welcome to the personal home page of **Sridhar Ratnakumar**, a passionate Haskeller (<2009703?cf>) and actualist (<7c5337fc?cf>). I have over a decade of experience in software development, and specialize in Haskell and Nix lately.  Take a look at [my résumé]( https://srid.keybase.pub/resume.pdf), and drop me an email if need my services.

This entire site is modeled based on the [Zettelkasten](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125) note taking method, and implemented using [neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page). On my free time, I work on neuron and the upcoming app [Cerveau](https://www.cerveau.app/).

## Navigating this site
