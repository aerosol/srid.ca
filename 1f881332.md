# Non-programming discussion

Where can [hackers](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#what_is) go to have civil and intelligent discussions on matters unrelated to programming?

## Tried and fail

* Hacker News used to be such a place, however it now suffers from censorship.
* Lobste.rs is no better in that regard. 
* And there is "Quillette Circle", which I most often found to be far from civil.

## New communities to try

While reading this [blog post](https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/22/nyt-is-threatening-my-safety-by-revealing-my-real-name-so-i-am-deleting-the-blog/), I came across a couple of reddit communities that may be worth trying:

* [r/slatestarcodex](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex)
* [r/TheMottle](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte)
