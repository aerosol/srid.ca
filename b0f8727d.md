# The new fashion of fighting for one's familial identity

{.ui .warning .message}
This note is a work in progress.

It has become fashionable nowadays, in the programming community, to emphasize the importance of love, familly, children and the like so as to downplay the hitherto dominant singled-minded passion about computers in the [hacker culture](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#what_is). 

Some contexts from Twitter (where low-effort posts abound, and thoughtless factoids spread like wild fire):

* On what "actually matters" in life: <https://twitter.com/sjsyrek/status/1276848455705604096>

## Underlying Psychology

* The human "need"[^need] to belong
* The strong desire for love, and to be loved
* The inability to break free of these bonds
* The lack of freedom to do the things one would want to do in life, if it not for the instinctual constraints
* The rationalization of one's bondage by downplaying anyone who lives more freely

[^need]: It is of course more accurate to describe this as a "desire" than a "need". The need to belong is unlike say the need for air and water; as you can live without the former (happily in fact).
