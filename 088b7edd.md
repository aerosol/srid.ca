# Handling HTTP errors in `req`

:::{.ui .warning .message}
### WIP
This is a work-in-progress note. Don't link to it just yet.
:::

The `req` package provides a `MonadHttp` class that has a [`handleHttpException`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/req-3.2.0/docs/Network-HTTP-Req.html#v:handleHttpException) method.  

How do we handle HTTP client errors in `Either` monad instead?
