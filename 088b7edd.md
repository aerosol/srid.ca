# Handling HTTP errors in `req`

:::{.ui .warning .message}
### WIP
This is a work-in-progress note. Don't link to it just yet.
:::

The `req` package provides a `MonadHttp` class that has a [`handleHttpException`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/req-3.2.0/docs/Network-HTTP-Req.html#v:handleHttpException) method.  

How do we handle HTTP client errors in `Either` monad instead?

## Trail

* Let's just see what other Haskellers have written. [GitHub code search](https://github.com/search?l=Haskell&q=handleHttpException+MonadHttp&type=Code).
  * A lot of them just `throwIO` which is useless for our purposes.
  * Tack on a `throwError` to the query to narrow down to the more interesting matches.
  * [eg: GraphiteM](https://github.com/AdamJKing/aphrograph/blob/7c48ef458bd8a177623e6d9f38b727872874680b/src/Graphite.hs#L51) - uses `ReaderT . ExceptT`; i.e. the ReaderT pattern of <fca6b335?cf>
  * and [DiscordM](https://github.com/cronokirby/funky-hs/blob/42e35c7c67b9051c1d28ddfdf64f3e4e34e67b9f/src/Network/Funky/Types.hs#L47) uses `ExceptT . ReaderT` but not as "wrapped".
