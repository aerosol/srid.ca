# Use Zettelkasten for personal reflection

I work with my private Zettelkasten notes predominantly for self-reflection purposes (see <7c5337fc?cf>). 

Every day while I sipping my morning cup of coffee, I contemplate on the recent life events and add any new observations or insights to my notes, and then form new connections between them. Sometimes this will have me consolidate multiple notes into one concept; often, a hitherto unacknowledged connection will be formed between two concepts.
