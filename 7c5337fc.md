The **actualism method** aims to mimic the perfection experienced in a peak experience by being in a good mood[^whymood] each and every moment (investigating all beliefs that stand in the way of that), until the moment dawns wherein that perfection becomes the de facto mode of experiencing (i.e., one becomes actually free). For more, read this introduction I wrote at letter.wiki: [On Suffering & Becoming Free Of It](https://letter.wiki/conversation/242).

[^whymood]: Why? Because it is much easier to *stay* in a good mood (preferably a happy mood, of course) than *claw one's way back* up to feeling good, again and again, after having habitually reverted to one's type.
