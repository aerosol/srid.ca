This note is a work-in-progress.

Lately the Indian film industry has started producing some great films and TV shows that don't follow the tired old [masala trope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masala_film). 

Some of my favourites:

* [**Breathe**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6466208/), an Indian crime drama thriller
