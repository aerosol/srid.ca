# the near-purity of the sincerity which inheres in naiveté

Description:

> RICHARD: **For those who are unable to recall/ unable to trigger a PCE there is the near-purity of the [sincerity](http://actualfreedom.com.au/richard/catalogue/sincere.htm) which inheres in [naiveté](http://actualfreedom.com.au/library/topics/naivete.htm)** – the nearest a ‘self’ can get to innocence whilst remaining a ‘self’ – which naiveté is an aspect of oneself locked away in childhood through ridicule, derision, and so on, that one has dared not to resurrect for fear of appearing foolish, a simpleton, in both others’ eyes and, thus, one’s own.[^ref]

Taking the first step to its discovery:

> Now, seeing the fact (as ‘I’ am ‘my’ feelings and ‘my’ feelings are ‘me’[^ifeel]) that it is plainly and simply ‘my’ choice as to how ‘I’ experience this moment[^choice] (the only moment one is actually alive) is a first step leading to its discovery.

And one needs to be interested of course:

> The intent is you will become happy and harmless.
> The intent is you will be free of sorrow and malice. The intent is you will become blithesome and benign. The intent is you will be free of fear and aggression. The intent is you will become carefree and considerate. The intent is you will be free from nurture and desire. The intent is you will become gay and benevolent. The intent is you will be free of anguish and animosity. The intent is that, by being free of the Human Condition, you will experience peace-on-earth, in this life-time, as this body ... as is evidenced in a pure consciousness experience (PCE) (...)

Interest enables sincerity, and *being* sincere unlocks naiveté:

> All of this vital interest/ vested interest enables sincerity – as to be in accord with the fact/being aligned with factuality/ staying true to facticity is what being sincere is (as in being authentic/ guileless, genuine/ artless, straightforward/ ingenuous) and to be sincere is to be the key which unlocks naiveté ... then the summing-up sentence can now look something like this:

[^ifeel]: <2d1a2ec8>
[^choice]: <974ce006>
