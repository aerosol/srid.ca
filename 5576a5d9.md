# the near-purity of the sincerity which inheres in naiveté

Description:

> RICHARD: **For those who are unable to recall/ unable to trigger a PCE there is the near-purity of the [sincerity](http://actualfreedom.com.au/richard/catalogue/sincere.htm) which inheres in [naiveté](http://actualfreedom.com.au/library/topics/naivete.htm)** – the nearest a ‘self’ can get to innocence whilst remaining a ‘self’ – which naiveté is an aspect of oneself locked away in childhood through ridicule, derision, and so on, that one has dared not to resurrect for fear of appearing foolish, a simpleton, in both others’ eyes and, thus, one’s own.[^ref]

Taking the first step to its discovery:

> Now, seeing the fact (as ‘I’ am ‘my’ feelings and ‘my’ feelings are ‘me’[^ifeel]) that it is plainly and simply ‘my’ choice as to how ‘I’ experience this moment[^choice] (the only moment one is actually alive) is a first step leading to its discovery.
