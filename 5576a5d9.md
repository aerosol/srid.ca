# the near-purity of the sincerity which inheres in naiveté

> RICHARD: **For those who are unable to recall/ unable to trigger a PCE there is the near-purity of the sincerity which inheres in naiveté** – the nearest a ‘self’ can get to innocence whilst remaining a ‘self’ – which naiveté is an aspect of oneself locked away in childhood through ridicule, derision, and so on, that one has dared not to resurrect for fear of appearing foolish, a simpleton, in both others’ eyes and, thus, one’s own.[^ref]
