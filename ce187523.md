# Freedom should be no. 1 priority

Feeling good *right now* should be one's top-most priority (at the expense of everything else) for the method to reliably work.

> [...] one has to reach out – extend oneself – like one has never done before. One has to **want[^desire] peace-on-earth as the number one priority in one’s life**. One has to desire freedom from the Human Condition to the point of **obsession and beyond** ... it is that **urgent and essential**. And one does it for a two-fold purpose: for the good of oneself in particular and for one’s fellow humans in general. <http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/sundry/frequentquestions/FAQ43a.htm>
