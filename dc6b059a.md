# Wanting is not wishful thinking

> RICHARD: The key to being free, then, is not altruism per se but wanting, with
  all of one’s being, to bring to an end, once and for all, the inherent
  suffering which epitomises human nature. Vis.:
> >
> > • \[Richard\]: ‘... one has to want it like one has never wanted anything else
    before ... so much so that all the instinctual passionate energy of desire,
    normally frittered away on petty desires, is fuelling and impelling/
    propelling one into this thing and this thing only (‘impelling’ as in a
    pulling from the front and ‘propelling’ as in being pushed from behind). There
    is a ‘must’ to it (one must do it/ it must happen) and a ‘will’ to it (one
    will do it/ it will happen) and one is both driven and drawn until there is an
    inevitability that sets in. Now it is unstoppable and all the above ceases of
    its own accord ... one is unable to distinguish between ‘me’ doing it and it
    happening to ‘me’. One has escaped one’s fate and achieved one’s destiny’.

  > RICHARD: I do not mean wanting it as in wishful thinking: when I say **one has
  to want it like one has never wanted anything else** before I mean it just like
  that ... like nothing else one has ever wanted before.

From srinathjelly:

> Richard had said that I needed to want it like nothing before. I pondered on
  what I had wanted before and recalled a simple childhood memory of being
  excited about going to the swimming pool when I was about 10 years old. There
  was this completely sincere and thrilling ‘jumping out of my skin’ desire to
  get in the pool. I was beginning to feel a similarly sincere thirst for
  oblivion.
