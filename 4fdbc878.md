# Developing on a dedicated server

{.ui .message .warning}
WIP

At the end of May 2020 I began renting a dedicated server ([Ryzen 7 3700 PRO](https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/dedicated-servers/infra/infra-limited-edition-2/)) for hosting [Cerveau](https://neuron.zettel.page/041726b3.html). A month later I decided to also use it as my *primary development* machine.

## Benefits

I find developing on a dedicated machine to be beneficial in many ways:

* **Portable lifestyle**: For lifestyle reasons, I am stuck with what power laptop offers. Even my "mobile workstation" Thinkpad P71 cannot match the CPU performance of the dedicated server. It compiles Haskell projects way faster.
