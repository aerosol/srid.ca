# Be fascinated

> Attentiveness is the **fascination** of the reflective contemplation that this moment is one’s only moment of being alive – and one is never alive at any other time than now.

> Whatever feeling one may be having, a **fascinated** attention – attentiveness – freely divulges it ... it is looking with discernibleness.

> The potent combination of attentiveness – **fascinated** reflective contemplation – and sensuousness produces apperception, which happens when the mind becomes aware of itself.

> The **fascinated** contemplation – ‘fascinated’ as in **a moth to a flame** – morphs into a pure contemplation (as in an apperceptivity) upon it becoming startlingly apparent as an experiential actuality that this moment in time has no duration.
