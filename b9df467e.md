# Status Anxiety

A term originally coined by Alain de Botton in [his book of the same name](https://www.alaindebotton.com/status/), to refer to the kind of anxiety we experience when our "position" in society (under whatever idiosyncratic context) is threatened. 

## Love and Authority

Status anxiety is linked to love and authority. They come together as a bundle.

## Actualism relevance

The root issue, it would seem, is that our identities are "separate" (using love as a form of bridge). "Our" existence, being relative to other identities, vyes for **position and status**. The solution is an actual intimacy[^intimacy].

> Richard: Actual intimacy – being here now – does not come from love, for love stems from separation. The illusion of intimacy that love produces is but a meagre imitation of this direct experience of the actual. In the actual world, ‘I’ as ego, the personality, and ‘me’ as soul, the ‘being’ – both subjectively experienced as one’s identity – have ceased to exist; whereas love accentuates, endorses and verifies ‘me’ as being real. And while ‘I’ am real, ‘I’ am relative to other similarly afflicted persons; vying for position and status in order to establish ‘my’ credentials … to verify ‘my’ very existence.

> To be actually intimate is to be without the separative identity … and therefore free from the need for love with its ever un-filled promise of Peace On Earth.[^intimacy]
