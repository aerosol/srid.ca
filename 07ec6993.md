Anti-racism, as it is *politically practiced*, is often a religion that is (paradoxically) [**covertly** racist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT2rlJe9cuU). It can insidiously cause affective harm to the very group of people it claims to protect.

> As a black man I don't find these words offensive because I understand they are used in a specific context.

> And that's all there is to it, you shouldn't have to justify yourself in any other way.

> People who try to pressure you into changing the terminology are often white people who think they represent me or other blacks, when the great majority of black people couldn't give a damn about that and have other things to deal with in the real world. It is just some people, often american, infantilizing and patronizing us deciding what should offend us or not.

> As for the people who insult you implying italian == fascist, well doesn't that demonstrate their villainy?
> 
> They want to assert their power on you,that's what they crave for and yes they are relentless. But give up an inch and you become their actual mental slave, because they will never cease to target you.
> 
> These are bullies and often racist themselves, disguising there racism with a coat of paternalism.
> 
> I don't need to be coddled or be considered so stupid I can't tell the difference between slavery and a cluster. That's insulting.
