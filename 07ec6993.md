# "Anti-racism" is pro-racism

Anti-racism "*has gone a long way from what used to be considered intelligent and sincere civil rights activism; today it's a [religion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT2rlJe9cuU) [that] any naive anthropologist would recognize as a faith*". It is [**covertly** racist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT2rlJe9cuU). It can insidiously cause affective harm to the very group of people it claims to protect[^ann].

## Go deeper than racism if you want to eliminate racism

The current anti-racism movement's activities are like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic (if they are not busy contributing to its further sinking that is).  

The problem is not so much "racism", as the deep human psycho-instinctual pattern of belonging to a group. Otherwise called as herd instinct. Unless humans willingly cease to cling to these archaic patterns of feeling and behaviour (which also underlie the so-called "positive" attributes like "solidarity"), nothing *fundamental* will change in regards to race relations (or any group relations for that matter).

Life is far more easier, simpler, felicitous and innocuous when people treat one another as **fellow human beings** rather than token-members of some $group. To treat a flesh and blood human being as, at their core, a member of some group is to be insulting to the individual.

## Anecdotal reports

* William's biography on "unlearning race", which is more or less what we should all be doing: [Self-Portrait in Black and White: Unlearning Race](https://www.amazon.com/Self-Portrait-Black-White-Unlearning-Race-ebook/dp/B07P9CQVPQ)

    [Here's](http://antirez.com/news/122#comment-4084872912) anecdote from a black person:

    > As a black man I don't find these words offensive because I understand they are used in a specific context.
    >
    > And that's all there is to it, you shouldn't have to justify yourself in any other way.
    > 
    > People who try to pressure you into changing the terminology are often white people who think they represent me or other blacks, when the great majority of black people couldn't give a damn about that and have other things to deal with in the real world. It is just some people, often american, infantilizing and patronizing us deciding what should offend us or not.
    > 
    > As for the people who insult you implying italian == fascist, well doesn't that demonstrate their villainy?
    > 
    > They want to assert their power on you,that's what they crave for and yes they are relentless. But give up an inch and you become their actual mental slave, because they will never cease to target you.
    > 
    > These are bullies and often racist themselves, disguising there racism with a coat of paternalism.
    > 
    > I don't need to be coddled or be considered so stupid I can't tell the difference between slavery and a cluster. That's insulting.
